Questions--->
1. What is the most popular project by category? (Completed) 

 1.1 After finding the top categories, we can narrow down on the top 3 and find out rate of success in their subcategories
(ie. If there is Film is in the top 3 category, we can see which of Drama, Comedey, Cartoon.... had the most success)    


2. What is the origin of the backers for th kickstarter projects? (Completed) 
3. rate of success of the company by each category. (Jason) 
4. Percentage of money recieved by money wanted. (Sahand)
which categories
5. How much time did it take to generate the money needed. (Mahmud) 
6. Top ten categories that earn money much faster and more than they required. (Mahmud)
7. Avg amount each backer pledged. (Sahand) 
8. Time: In which year Kickstarter had the most projects. Is the website growing in numbers of projects vs time? (Arrick) 
9. Canceled projects vs funds (Is there any case that they got the fund and canceled? (possibly because of  frauds or failed           prototype?)  trying to find a pattern in canceld projects. (looking at the categories: which categories got more cancelations. 
Is there a pattern with Projects Origin Country and Cancelations in percentage...) (Sahand)

Questions that need to be reviewed
1. Does more backers imply more success? Higher average of money donated by backers imply more success? percentage of pledge(compared to goal) imply more success?
2. There are projects that were successful even though they did not make their fundraising goal.  The difference between the goal and pledge looks small.  Calculate this maximum deficit proportional, even though you did not make your goal, you might want to reconsider to keep on with project, use past values of deficits to consider to reconsider continuing.

Above 2 questions were under the assumption that state=success meant project was successful.

3. Does increase in days to reach goal imply more success in reaching goal?

4. Make a field for the percentage of the goal pledged. Make a field the time for fundraising, ie deadline date subtract launch date, ie,.  Graph and calculate correlation between these two fields.(jason)

5. Does bigger goals result in less success in reaching goal?

6. Does more backer imply more success? What if about higher average(total pledged/# of backers) implies anything about success?

7. Calculate the proportion of goal met, look for any pattern?

8. Does launching on a certain have better success rate?

Invalid Questions
10. Success rate of projects with insufficient funding, should a project be continued even with insufficient funding (Jason)
Projects only start if the funding goal is met.


9. We need more questions! and need to apply more complex analysis/ charts 
   
Conclusion :-->
What category? How much money to ask? How much time does it take trend on kickstarter? (Arrick)
